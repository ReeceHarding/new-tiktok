Instructions

1. Review and Understand the Codebase
   - Read all relevant files following the call trace from the frontend to the final output.
   - Inspect every line to ensure code calls match expected behavior.

2. Develop Modular Code
   - Follow modular principles: Single Responsibility (SRP), DRY, and KISS.
   - Ensure failures in one module do not affect others.

3. Trace the Call Flow
   - Continue reading files until you fully understand the complete call traceâ€”from the frontend request to the final response.

4. Integrate with the Existing Codebase
   - Verify that new documents and code work seamlessly with the current system.
   - Search the entire codebase to avoid duplicating existing functionality.
   - Add new code/files without removing or altering current functionality.

5. Ensure Schema Consistency
   - For each element, document:
     - What the schema expects.
     - What the code is calling.
   - Resolve any discrepancies so that every code call exists in the schema.

6. Document Your Process
   - Write out your chain of thought for every piece of code you develop.
   - After implementing each feature, trace the complete call from start to finish.
   - Identify and fix all inconsistencies until the entire call trace returns consistent information.

7. Use Environment Configurations
   - Read the `.env.local` file to review declared configurations and ensure proper integration.
   - your default funcitonlaty should be editing current files rather than creating new redundant ones
   - run xcodebuild -scheme ProductivityTalk -sdk iphonesimulator -verbose after all code you generate to make sure everything works
